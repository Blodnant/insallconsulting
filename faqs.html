            A: We offer both options. For well-defined projects, we can work on a fixed-price basis, while for ongoing or evolving projects, hourly or retainer-based billing may be more suitable.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Are there any hidden fees?</strong><br>
            A: No, we believe in full transparency. All costs are clearly outlined in our proposal, so you know exactly what to expect from the start. Of course requirements may evolve as, together, we learn from customer feedback and identify additional value opportunities. So there may be additional tools or features that carry additional cost, but these will be agreed together before proceeding.</p>

            <h2>8. Getting Started</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: How do I get started with your services?</strong><br>

            A: It’s helpful to have a general outline of your goals, target audience, budget, and any existing materials related to your project. This will help us understand your needs and provide tailored recommendations.</p>
