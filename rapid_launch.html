            <h1>Rapid Launch</h1>
            <p>Got an idea for a website or app but don’t want to wait months to get it up and running?</p>
            <p>Building a website doesn’t have to take forever or cost the earth. There are lots of ways to get started, depending on what you need and how much you’re willing to spend. Here’s a quick look at some options that we could help you with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic HTML / CSS websites – Quick to make, limited functionality, but with the lowest monthly hosting costs.</li>
                <li>Template-based websites (like Shopify, Squarespace, or WordPress) – Out of the box websites with some good functionality, but customising it to be just right can take longer.</li>
                <li>No-code platforms (like Bubble.io) – great for building websites or apps with extra features.</li>
                <li>A mix of no-code tools and custom backend systems – for more tailored needs.</li>
                <li>Fully custom-built solutions hosted on the cloud (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The tricky part isn’t just deciding how to build your website – it’s knowing what your business really needs to succeed. That’s why starting small and simple is often the smartest move. Using a no-code tool like Bubble.io, we can build you something quickly and professionally, getting your idea into the hands of your customers fast. And we won't just make you a hollow prototype, instead we can make you a fully functional and tested solution that your customers can use.</p>
            <h2>Why is this better?</h2>
            <p>It’s easy to get carried away and spend loads of time and money on a big, complicated site or app, only to find out it’s not quite right for your business. A small, quick prototype lets you test your idea, gather feedback, and refine it – saving you time, money, and headaches down the road.</p>

            <h2>Here’s how we can help:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We’ll create a modern, professional website to showcase your business – ready in just a few days!</li>
                <li>If you need something more advanced, like user logins or private pages, we can have a feature-packed site ready in a few weeks (depending on the complexity).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let’s get your idea off the ground and in front of your customers, quickly and affordably. Ready to get started?</p>
